                        <p>It has been so nice being able to run and do errands during the week.
                            I'm pretty grateful that I've been able to get some housework and 
                            errands done lately. It can be said that when it rains, it pours.
                            Our toilet, bathroom light fixture, and fridge in the kitchen broke, 
                            but I'm 
                            grateful that we have our old fridge in the garage that still works!
                            Hopefully the toilet and light fixture are going to be easy fixes.<br>
                            Being a homeowner is hard!

                        <p>I would say that the secret to success is having a growth mindset.
                        You will never have all of the answers. I will never know why some things
                        happen in the world and that is okay. You just have to be willing to put in the time, 
                        energy and effort it takes to figure out whatever <em>it</em> is that you are trying to do. 
                        I want to help as many people as I can to enjoy the limited amount of time that we have on this earth.<br>
                        Our time is the only thing that is truly valuable.

                        <p>My name is Elisha, and I am married with two daughters--a 9-year-old and a one year-old. While I have worked as an
                        account manager for insurance companies for the last seven years, I am looking for a new direction in my career. I recently
                        graduated with an MBA in Marketing. 
                        
                        I am a member of the Women Growing Together Express Network (WGTEN) and have been a member of Victoria Professional
                        Express Network (VPEN), both chapters of the American Business Women's Association (ABWA). I have also twice been named
                        Business Woman of the Month--once for VPEN and once for WGTEN.
